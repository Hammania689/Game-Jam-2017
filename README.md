Blue Jack Attack is a 2.5 D platformer set in the mysterious, tech-inspired Sound Dimension in which the protagonist must navigate around charged platforms operated by mean machines called the Retrosynth. This strange realm contains the golden audio jack that will open the portal to the next realm, so the player can defeat the evil Dr. Boom. In the game's current state, it shows one level. Movement keys used, aside from arrow keys, are the W, S, D, A keys. Spacebar provides a jump, which can be used multiple times as long as there is stamina. To spawn the key, the player must destroy one of the enemies.
